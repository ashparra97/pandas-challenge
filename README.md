###### Disclosure: This assignment was done in collaboration with Jason Wang. 

## Summary 

This assignment analyzed data from a video game company on their newly-released game called Heroes of Pymoli.

## Process 
Utilizing the pandas library, this code first determined the number of unique players who have engaged with the game. It then ran a purchasing analysis that identified the number of unique items purchased, average purchase price of the items, total number of purchases, and the total revenue. 

An analysis of gender was also done which not only found the percentage and counts of players by percentage, but also the purchase count, average purchase price, total purchase value, and average purchase total per person all by gender.

Similarly, an analysis of age was done which looked into eight different age groups (ranging from <10 to 40+). The same analyses were done as with gender.

Lastly, the top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items were identified and demonstrated in their respective summary tables.
